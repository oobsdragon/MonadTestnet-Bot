# MonadTestnet-Bot: Automated Auto-Farm for Monad Testnet Yields

![Monad Testnet Bot Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400.png?text=MonadTestnet-Bot)

Welcome to the MonadTestnet-Bot project. This bot automates farming on the Monad Testnet. It handles wallet interactions, staking, harvesting, and compounding to optimize yields on the test network. It is designed to be reliable, transparent, and easy to operate for developers and test participants who run on the Monad ecosystem.

Throughout this guide you’ll find practical setup steps, concrete commands, and clear explanations. The goal is to help you deploy and operate the bot safely on the Monad Testnet, learn how it works under the hood, and contribute if you want to improve it.

Why this bot matters
- Automates repetitive farming tasks on the Monad Testnet. It reduces manual workload and minimizes human error during testnet farming experiments.
- Improves consistency of farming strategies across multiple test wallets or testnet accounts.
- Helps developers simulate real-world usage of farming strategies in a controlled environment.
- Provides a clean starting point for building more complex automation on the Monad ecosystem.

What the bot does
- Connects to the Monad Testnet via a safe, read-only view of the blockchain to monitor pool states and rewards.
- Stakes liquidity to eligible farming pools on your behalf, if you enable it.
- Harvests rewards when they accrue and compounds them automatically if configured.
- Maintains basic state persistence to recover from restarts or temporary network issues.
- Supports multiple wallets and multiple farming strategies, enabling you to test different scenarios in parallel.
- Exposes a straightforward CLI and configuration model so you can adjust behavior without recompiling.

How it works under the hood
- The bot runs as a standalone process that interacts with the Monad Testnet through a lightweight client.
- It uses a deterministic scheduling loop to check pool states at regular intervals.
- It stores essential state (balances, last harvest time, configuration) in a local, lightweight datastore with simple backups.
- It provides a safe default configuration that minimizes risk while delivering observable yield improvements on testnet farming.
- It separates concerns: a core engine handles blockchain interactions, a scheduler coordinates actions, and a pluggable strategy module defines farming rules.

Core features
- Multi-wallet support: Run automation for multiple test accounts.
- Strategy pluggability: Define how and when to harvest, compound, or withdraw rewards.
- Config-driven behavior: Changes take effect without code changes.
- Safe defaults: Configurations prioritize safety and low risk during testing.
- Observability: Basic metrics and logs to trace activity and outcomes.
- Lightweight footprint: Designed to run on common dev machines, CI runners, or lightweight servers.

Architecture and components
- Core engine: Handles the main flow of connecting to the Monad Testnet, reading pool states, and executing actions.
- Scheduler: Triggers activities on a defined cadence and ensures tasks don’t overlap or conflict.
- Strategy layer: Encapsulates the rules for farming, harvesting, and compounding.
- Configuration manager: Reads, validates, and applies user configurations.
- Persistence layer: Stores state locally to recover gracefully after restarts.
- Logging and telemetry: Outputs structured logs and simple runtime metrics.

Getting started: prerequisites
- A Monad Testnet wallet: You’ll need a wallet address with a testnet balance to participate in farming.
- Access to the Monad Testnet network: The bot expects to connect to an accessible RPC endpoint or a testnet node.
- A computer or server that can run the bot: This can be a developer machine, a VM, or a small cloud instance.
- Basic familiarity with terminal/command-line operations.
- Optional but helpful: Docker and Docker Compose for containerized deployment.

Installation and delivery options
- Option 1: Download and run a prebuilt release asset
  - This approach is fast and straightforward. You download a ready-to-run binary or script from the official releases page, then execute it with minimal setup.
  - Important: The asset you download is distributed through the official Releases page, and you run the executable directly. This keeps the process simple and reproducible.
- Option 2: Build from source
  - If you want to inspect the code, customize behavior, or contribute, you can build from source. This path requires the proper toolchain for the project language and its dependencies.
  - Building from source gives you full visibility into the logic and easier debugging.
- Option 3: Dockerized deployment
  - For predictable environments, run the bot inside a container. This reduces the risk of environment drift and simplifies deployment.

Quickstart: run the bot
- Option A: Use a prebuilt release asset
  - Find the asset on the Releases page. Download the appropriate binary for your OS, then make it executable and run it.
  - Example commands (Linux/macOS):
    - chmod +x MonadTestnet-Bot
    - ./MonadTestnet-Bot --config path/to/your-config.yaml
  - Example commands (Windows):
    - MonadTestnet-Bot.exe --config path\to\your-config.yaml
  - The bot will read the provided configuration, connect to the Monad Testnet, and begin farming according to the configured strategy.
- Option B: Build from source
  - Clone the repository, install dependencies, and build the binary.
  - Run the built binary with a configuration file.
  - If you want to run tests, use the project’s test suite.
- Option C: Docker deployment
  - Use the provided Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml if available.
  - Launch the container with a mounted configuration file and appropriate environment variables.

Configuration and customization
- Configuration file format
  - The bot uses a YAML-based configuration for readability and ease of editing.
  - Key sections include wallets, pools, strategies, timing, and logging.
- Wallet configuration
  - Provide your wallet address, and, if needed, credentials or keys in a secure manner.
  - The bot handles signing for the relevant transactions and never transmits private keys unprotected.
- Pool and strategy configuration
  - List the pools you want to farm and the corresponding parameters.
  - Define harvesting cadence, compounding frequency, and any withdrawal rules.
- Scheduling and timing
  - Set the poll interval for the bot to check pool states.
  - Define a harvest window to avoid excessive network calls during peak network times.
- Logging and observability
  - Enable or disable verbose logs.
  - Route logs to a local file or a logging service.
- Safety options
  - You can configure limits, such as maximum harvests per day or maximum investment per pool, to reduce risk during testing.

Running in production
- Prepare a stable environment
  - Use a dedicated user account, isolated network access, and a controlled environment.
  - Ensure the machine clock is accurate to avoid drift in scheduling.
- Security considerations
  - Keep sensitive data secure in a protected configuration store.
  - Use read-only endpoints if you do not need write access to the testnet, and enable write access only for necessary actions.
- Observability and alerts
  - Set up logs and metrics to monitor bot activity.
  - Configure alerts to notify you on unexpected errors or when harvests fail.

Monitoring, logs, and observability
- Basic logs
  - The bot emits startup, configuration, and action logs.
  - Logs help you verify that the bot is harvesting or compounding as expected.
- Metrics
  - Track rewards earned per pool, total yield, and bot uptime.
- Debugging tips
  - Increase log verbosity during initial runs to understand behavior.
  - Validate network connectivity to the Monad Testnet node.
- Telemetry privacy
  - Logs do not reveal private keys or sensitive wallet data. They may include public addresses and pool identifiers for traceability.

Testing strategy
- Unit tests
  - Validate core calculations, timing logic, and state transitions.
- Integration tests
  - Verify end-to-end behavior with a testnet node in a controlled environment.
- Manual testing
  - Run the bot with a small config on a test wallet to verify that actions are performed as expected.
- Staging and local environments
  - Use a staging environment that mirrors production behavior before deploying to a live test wallet.
